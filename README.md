### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Tiago](https://www.tiagopbrodrigues.com/)

I'm a university student living in Portugal. I love web development, especially the back-end part, but I also enjoy the front-end a lot, particularly Svelte. I love going to the gym, watching Benfica win, and constantly improving myself in every way I can.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on some top-secret side projects, to learn more about web technologies, but also want to dive into some more low-level stuff.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), to try and become a well-rounded developer.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I intend to visit every country in the world and spend at least a week in each one
