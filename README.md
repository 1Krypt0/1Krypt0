### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Tiago](https://www.tiagopbrodrigues.com/)

I'm a university student living in Portugal. I love web development, especially the back-end part, but I also enjoy the front-end a lot, especially Angular. I love going to the gym, watching Benfica win and spending time with my girlfriend, especially travelling around the world.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some top secret side projects, to learn more about web technologies.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning [Nest](https://nestjs.com/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) and a bit about [Adonis](https://adonisjs.com/).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Arch, Emacs, Productivity and University life.

- ðŸ“” Check out my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KwOkKca15Qu0sQ3muh21ADBqYabnHrEr/view)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I intend to visit every country in the world and spend at least a week in each one
